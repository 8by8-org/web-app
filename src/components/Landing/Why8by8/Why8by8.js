          AAPI hate crimes have shot through the roof during the pandemic, yet
          there's limited media coverage. 8by8 gives me the opportunity to use
          my skills to advance political and social equality for the AAPI
          community and help increase voter turnout. The AAPI community deserves
          a future where we're treated the same and our culture is respected.

          It is was heart-breaking to know that the AAPI community, including my
          Indonesian friends, is still subjected to racism and discrimination. I
          was greatly encouraged to join 8by8 to contribute to the AAPI
          community and call out issues with the government and our society. I
          hope to do this not only in the US, but also everywhere across the
          world!

          The protagonists of my favorite Asian anime shows (DBZ, My Hero
          Academia, and Naruto) have taught me to always help those in danger.
          After hearing about the hate crimes from the news and from my AAPI
          peers, I wanted to help but didn't know how. Luckily I found 8by8, and
          I resonated with their goal to protect AAPI rights through voter
          registration.

          I joined the 8by8 partnerships team hoping to leverage my network and
          make a difference to the future of AAPI in America. Voter registration
          is a great starting point. My dream is to build a chain of modern and
          inclusive community centers for Asian Americans. With more civic
          engagement and political presence, the journey for modern Asian
          Community Centers can be easier and smoother!
