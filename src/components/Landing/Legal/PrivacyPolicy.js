      <p>
        This website and associated tools, such as subscribing for emails, is
        owned and operated by 8by8 Inc. and we have a firm commitment to your
        privacy and Internet privacy in general. We are committed to protecting
        the privacy of our visitors and users while they interact with the
        content and services on this site (www.app.8by8.us, the “Site”). This
        Privacy Policy applies to the Site and 8by8 owned services only. It does
        not apply to other websites to which we may link. We do gather certain
        types of information about our users, so we want you to understand what
        information we collect about you, how we collect it, how that
        information is used, and how you can control our disclosure of it. You
        agree that your use of the Site signifies your assent to this Privacy
        Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use
        this Site.
      </p>

      <h2>Information collected</h2>
      <p>
        We collect two (2) types of information from you: 1) information that
        you voluntarily supply in form fields on this Site (e.g., sign-up for
        email); and 2) information that may be derived through automated
        tracking mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h2>Voluntary Information for Services and Features</h2>
      <p>
        We collect personally identifiable information when you choose to use
        certain other features of the Site, including a) consenting to receive
        email, and b) participating in any social media interaction as part of
        the Site. When you choose to use these additional features, we may
        require you to provide your “Contact Information” in addition to other
        personal information that may be required to complete a transaction.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        The Site uses “cookies” and other web tracking technologies. Cookies
        enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign
        in repeatedly. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including
        whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. If a user’s system
        is idle for a defined time, the cookie may expire, and if so, forcing
        the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents
        unauthorized access to the user’s information while they are away from
        their computer. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a
        cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.
      </p>
